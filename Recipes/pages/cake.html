    <p>
      This aptly named Better Than Sex Cake — complete with a sweetened
      condensed milk-caramel sauce, chocolate-covered toffee, and whipped
      topping — is as indulgent as it gets.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>½ (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
      <li>8 ounces caramel ice cream topping, divided</li>
      <li>3 ¼ (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered toffee, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of
        a 9x13-inch glass pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with a
        mixer on medium speed until well combined. Pour into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center
        comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes.
        Cut shallow slits across top of cake; make sure not to touch the bottom
        of the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine sweetened condensed milk and 6 ounces caramel topping
        in a saucepan over low heat; stir until smooth. Slowly pour mixture over
        top of warm cake, letting it soak in. Set aside 1 to 2 tablespoons
        chopped chocolate toffee for decorating; sprinkle remaining toffee
        liberally across entire cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool cake completely, then top with whipped topping. Decorate top of
        cake with the reserved toffee and drizzle with remaining caramel
        topping.
      </li>
      <li>Refrigerate until chilled through and serve right from the pan.</li>
    </ol>
